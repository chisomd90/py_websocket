## 1. Introduction

The multiplayer game is a real-time, WebSocket-powered game that allows multiple players to connect and play together in a shared gaming environment. The game supports features such as player movements, ball movements, scoring, and chat.

## 2. Getting Started

### 2.1 Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Flask-SocketIO

### 2.2 Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Create a Python virtual environment and activate it.
3. Install the required dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## 3. WebSocket Connection

The game utilizes Flask and Flask-SocketIO to establish WebSocket connections. Players can connect using a game ID, and real-time interactions are facilitated through WebSocket events.

To test a successful WebSocket connection, follow these steps:

1. Start the Flask application with `python app.py`.
2. Open a new browser tab and enter a URL like `http://localhost:5000/start_game?game_id=my_game_id`, replacing `my_game_id` with your desired game ID.
3. You should see a successful WebSocket connection and a displayed game ID.

## 4. Gameplay

- Player movements are synchronized in real-time between all connected players.
- Ball movements are shared among players to maintain a consistent game state.
- Scores, game state, and chat messages are updated and displayed in real-time.
- Players can interact with each other within the game environment.

## 5. Deployment

To deploy the multiplayer game for public access, follow these steps:

1. Host your Flask application on a web server.
2. Set up a domain or use a public IP address.
3. Update the WebSocket URL in the client-side code to match the server's address.

## 6. Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or fix.
3. Commit your changes and push them to your fork.
